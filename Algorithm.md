# FUNCTIONS USED IN THE CODE


**create_board():**

    creates the board as a graph by representing it as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix

**snakes():**

    updates the already created board by adding  the snakes in the graph representation

**ladders():**
    
    updates the already created board by adding  the snakes in the graph representation
    
**display_graph():**

    displays the board in the form of graph represenation either in adjacency matrix or adjacency list
   
**bfs():**
    
    implements the breadth first search algorithm on the board and returns the minimum number of dice rolls required to reach the last square
    
**path():**

    gives the shortest path for reaching the last cell of the board
 
**enqueue():**

    inserts an element into the queue used while performing bfs 

**dequeue():**

    deletes and returns an element from the queue used while performing bfs
